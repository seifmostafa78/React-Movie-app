## Overview
The React Movie App is a simple and interactive movie search application built with React.js. This app allows users to search for movies and view detailed information such as titles, release years, plot summaries, ratings, and more. The data is fetched from the [OMDb API](http://www.omdbapi.com/), providing real-time movie information.

## Features
- **Movie Search:** Users can search for movies by title.
- **Responsive Design:** The app is fully responsive and works seamlessly on both desktop and mobile devices.
- **Real-Time Data:** The app fetches movie data in real-time from the OMDb API.
- **Loading Indicator:** Displays a loading spinner while the app fetches movie data.

## Technologies Used
- **React.js:** For building the user interface and managing state.
- **OMDb API:** For retrieving movie data such as titles, plots, ratings, etc.
- **Fetch API:** For making HTTP requests to the OMDb API.
- **CSS:** For styling the app and making it visually appealing.
- **JavaScript ES6:** For building application logic and functionality.

## How to Run the Project

### Prerequisites
Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed on your machine:
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (version 14 or higher)
- [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) (comes with Node.js)

### Steps
1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/react-movie-app.git

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
